Sequential linear Regression Slopes
A remote sensing based method developed to analyse changes in functioning of dryland vegetation.

The method aims at analysing functioning rather than pure productivity indices (e.g. NDVI). 
Since vegetation productivity in drylands in mainly determined by precipitation, this relationship may be described through a linear regression. The slope of a linear regression is known to reflect the unit change in the dependent variable (vegetation productivity) per unit change in the independent variable (precipitation) and can therefore be used as an indicator for vegetation functioning in drylands. 
As the slope is representing vegetation functioning - changes in the slope over time may represent changes in vegetation biophysical processes, thus indicate changes in vegetation functioning.
